# Tic Tac Toe
## Introduction
Hello, and welcome to Tic Tac Toe! This simple game was written in Java and built with Gradle for my Software Engineering I class, or CS 310.
## Installation
To install Tic Tac Toe, you will need to click 'Clone or download', then 'Download ZIP'. Find the ZIP folder in your computer's Downloads folder, then unzip it to a location you will keep track of. To run Tic Tac Toe, you will need to find the .jar file in build > libs > cs310-tic-tac-toe-2.0.jar. Once you have found this file, you may double-click it to execute the program.
## Objective and Instructions
Tic Tac Toe is a two player game, so you will need another person to play against you! The object of Tic Tac Toe is to align three characters (either Xs or Os, depending on which player you are) across a 3x3 grid horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. 
Player X will go first. Click on any tile to place your mark on the grid. Your turn will end, and then Player O will make their mark on the grid with the objective in mind. This will continue until one of three conditions is met: Player X aligns three characters, Player O aligns three characters, or a tie occurs in which all tiles have been used without a player victory. To restart the game, press the red X in the upper-right corner of the window and run the .jar file again.
